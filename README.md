## Description

For this project I created a website that displays your teams information. The reason for creating this website was to simplify keeping track of your workers. While working on this website I learned how to use classes and how you can build classes onto other classes. I also learned how to run tests that can ultimately help you with debugging your code.

## Installation

In order to install my website, one must download my github repo and type in node index.js in the console to start the prompt.

## Usage

Using my project is very simple. Once the files are loaded on to your vscode, you simply type in node index.js to start the prompt. Once you are finished with the prompt questions, a HTML file will be created in the dist folder that displays your generated team.

## Tests

In order to assure my project worked effectively, I used Jest npm to run my tests. For each test that I created, I made sure all my functions were gathering the correct data. In order to run the tests you simply type npm run test in the terminal.
